# H1 header
## H2 header
### H3 header
#### H4 header
##### H5 header
###### H6 header

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`.

Itemized lists look like:
* this one
* that one
* the other one

Have some emojis: 💻 ⌨️ 🖱️

Here is an en-dash: --, em-dash: ---, elipsis: ..., and  "quotes".

Here's a numbered list:
1. first item
2. second item
3. third item

> Block quotes are written like so:
> - Some
> - Another
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs, if you like.

Here's a code sample:
```
  # Let me re-iterate ...
  for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }
```

You can optionally mark the delimited block for prism to syntax highlight it:

```python
import hashlib

def hash_file(filename):
   """"This function returns the SHA-1 hash
   of the file passed into it"""

   # make a hash object
   h = hashlib.sha1()

   # open file for reading in binary mode
   with open(filename,'rb') as file:

       # loop till the end of the file
       chunk = 0
       while chunk != b'':
           # read only 1024 bytes at a time
           chunk = file.read(1024)
           h.update(chunk)

   # return the hex representation of digest
   return h.hexdigest()

message = hash_file("track1.mp3")
print(message)
```

~~You can also strikethrough a line.~~

Now a nested list:

1. First, use these tools:
    * vscode
    * eslint
    * typescript
    * prettier

2. Boil some water.

3. Dump everything in the pot and follow this algorithm:

    ```jsx {5,8}
    function tick() {
      const element = (
        <div>
          <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
          <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
        </div>
      );
      ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
    }

    setInterval(tick, 1000);
  ```

  Don't forget you can highlight lines as well!

Here's a link to [a website](https://github.com/sebsojeda/gatsby-theme-purity) and to a [section heading in the current
doc](#h2-header). Here are footnotes [^1] [^2].

[^1]: Some footnote text.
[^2]: Some more notes.

Tables look like this:

| Name         | Size | Material    | Color       |
| ------------ | ---- | ----------- | ----------- |
| All Business | 9    | leather     | brown       |
| Roundabout   | 10   | hemp canvas | natural     |
| Cinderella   | 11   | glass       | transparent |

Multi-line tables:

| Keyword | Text                  |
| ------- | --------------------- |
| red     | Sunsets, apples,<br/>and other red or<br/>reddish things. |
| green   | Leaves, grass, frogs<br/>and other things it's<br/>not easy being. |

A horizontal rule follows.

Images can be specified like so:

![example image](./square.png "An exemplary image")

And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \`foo\`, \*bar\*, etc.
